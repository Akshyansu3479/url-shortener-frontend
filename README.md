# URL Shortener

This URL shortener uses a **cloud-based architecture** designed for **high availability**, **automatic scaling**, and **fault tolerance**.  
With **auto-scaling** and **load balancers**, it adapts to traffic fluctuations, ensuring **optimal performance** and **cost-efficiency**.  
The fault-tolerant design guarantees **reliability**, keeping the system available even during failures or peak loads.
