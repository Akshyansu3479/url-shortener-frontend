# URL Shortener

This URL shortener uses a **cloud-based architecture** designed for **high availability**, **automatic scaling**, and **fault tolerance**. 
With **auto-scaling** and **load balancers**, it adapts to traffic fluctuations, ensuring **optimal performance** and **cost-efficiency**. 
The fault-tolerant design guarantees **reliability**, keeping the system available even during failures or peak loads.

## Features
- High availability
- Automatic scaling based on traffic
- Fault tolerance for reliability
- Efficient resource management for cost-effectiveness
